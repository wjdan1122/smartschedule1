# SmartSchedule â€“ Schedule Management System

SmartSchedule is a web-based system developed using React and Bootstrap for the frontend, Node.js (Express) for the backend, and PostgreSQL as the database. It allows students and staff at King Saud University to efficiently handle schedule management.
